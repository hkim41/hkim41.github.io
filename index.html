    <h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		Hello, my name is Hayoon Kim and I am a Senior at Rutgers University- New Brunswick. I am studying Computer Science and looking to work in either data science, software engineering, web design, and cybersecurity.
		<br/>
    <br/>
		Some programming languages I have experience in are Java, C, Python, SQL, Android, and a little bit of R. I have also used HTML and CSS in order to create websites through front end development.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also an Eagle Scout and a former high school wrestler. I am a disciplined individual with lots of experience in communication, teamwork, leadership, and an understanding of hard work.
	As an Eagle Scout, I have lots of experience with volunteering for different organizations and communicating with a wide variety of people such as volunteering at a homeless womens shelter, working at an event for disabled kids, and more.
	I have also been a project manager, being involved in getting sponsors, donations, and ensuring its execution is satisfactory to the beneficiary. I developed the project plan and recruited volunteers to assist me with its completion.
	<br/>
    <br/>
	As a high school wrestler, I learned what it means to work hard and not just that, but to work harder than anybody else. I have sacrificed many things that regular people would not even dream of: meals, holidays to practice, and waking up early on weekends to go to tournaments.
	While it sucked, it was worth it, to chase after something greater than myself, and to make memories and bonds that will last a lifetime. There were many times when I wanted to quit, but I decided not to, I stuck with the sport and fell in love with it.
	Through this sport I gained an appreciation for life and I learned how to truly handle adversity. My mental game has become stronger and I believe I can effectively use it not just in sports but in life, and the workforce as well.
