    <h1>Welcome to my personal website.</h1>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student eager to expand my skillset and gain experience in programming.</p>

    <h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
		Hello, my name is Hayoon Kim and I am a Senior at Rutgers University- New Brunswick. I am studying Computer Science and looking to work in either data science, software engineering, web design, and cybersecurity.
		<br/>
    <br/>
		Some programming languages I have experience in are Java, C, Python, SQL, Android, and a little bit of R. I have also used HTML and CSS in order to create websites through front end development.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also an Eagle Scout and a former high school wrestler. I am a disciplined individual with lots of experience in communication, teamwork, leadership, and an understanding of hard work.
	As an Eagle Scout, I have lots of experience with volunteering for different organizations and communicating with a wide variety of people such as volunteering at a homeless womens shelter, working at an event for disabled kids, and more.
	I have also been a project manager, seeing my project from getting sponsors and donations, to its execution. I developed the project and recruited volunteers to assist me with its completion.
	</p>
