    <h1>Introduction to the Rutgers MBS Exchange Program</h1>
    <p>
	The Rutgers MBS Externship Exchange program pairs students with company mentors and allows students to have a hands on learning opportunity to grow their skillset and interact with real world professionals.
	This is a semester long virtual experience where students work as a team to complete a project given by their mentors. Student teams are also assigned an advisor who is in the RUtgers MBS program to guide their interactions with these professionals.
	Students meet in weekly labs to grow their skills such as elevator pitches, giving presentations, communicating their skillsets, and networking.
	<br/>
    <br/>
	Through this program, I have worked with CGI, a consulting firm, and am planning to continue the program next semester, though being paired with a different mentor.

	<h1>My Takeaways From the Program</h1>
	<p>
	The Rutgers MBS Externship Exchange program has taught me a lot about what to expect in the real world, especially in the realm of software development and computer science.
	<br/>
    <br/>
	Through this program, I have had to work with new tools I never heard of and so I learned how to read documentation and work through bugs of unfamiliar tools.
	I encountered many obstacles, both technically and with soft skills. I had to learn to work with a team of diverse individuals, including some who were not familiar with computer science at all and so interdisciplinary communication was an important skill that I picked up.
	I was able to break through my confort zone and gain some familiarity with these new tools.
	</p>
	<br/>
    <br/>
	<p>
	As these projects are randomly assigned, I do not know which projects I will be matched with and have no choice over it.
	This leads to me being paired with projects I am not looking forward to working with but when you don't get what you want, remaining positive and making the most of it is a skill too.
	Even though a task may seem menial, it may be important to the employer who assigned it and so regardless I put my best foot forward in completeing the tasks assigned to me to ensure satisfaction from my mentors.
	Though my second project has no technical component to it whatsoever, I still learned about the different stages and requirements in developing a project and gained some soft skills along the way.
	I was not able to become team lead for the second project. Yet I was undettered and because I had prior experience, I was able to give my team members guidance while allowing the team lead to perform his duties without getting in his way.
