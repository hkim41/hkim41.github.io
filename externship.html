    <h1>Introduction to the Rutgers MBS Exchange Program</h1>
    <p>
	The Rutgers MBS Externship Exchange program pairs students with company mentors and allows students to have a hands on learning opportunity to grow their skillset and interact with real world professionals.
	This is a semester long virtual experience where students work as a team to complete a project given by their mentors. Student teams are also assigned an advisor who is in the RUtgers MBS program to guide their interactions with these professionals.
	Students meet in weekly labs to grow their skills such as elevator pitches, giving presentations, communicating their skillsets, and networking.
	<br/>
    <br/>
	Through this program, I have worked with CGI, a consulting firm, and am planning to continue the program next semester, though being paired with a different mentor.
